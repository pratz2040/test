# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

When you run the `npm start` command in a Node.js project, it typically does the following:

1. **Starts the Development Server:** Launches a local server to serve the application during development.
2. **Opens the Application in a Browser:** Automatically opens the application in the default web browser.
3. **Enables Live Reloading:** Watches for changes in the source files and automatically reloads the application when changes are detected.

In the context of a Create React App project, `npm start` runs the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

For more details, you can refer to the [official Create React App documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).

### `npm test`
When you run the `npm test` command in a Node.js project, it typically performs the following:

1. **Runs Test Suites:** Executes the test scripts defined in your project. For a Create React App project, it uses Jest as the test runner.
2. **Displays Results:** Shows the results of the test cases, indicating which tests passed and which failed.
3. **Watches for Changes:** In watch mode, it reruns tests automatically when changes are made to the source files or test files.

In the context of Create React App, `npm test` runs the appâ€™s test suite in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
